This repo contains code for the following. 
- Pull metrics from the official Garmin Connect API
- Use the Garmin MCP for chat related queries
- Summary feature for features/trends which you enable it for

Having a LLM inferencing layer on top of fitness metrics/datasets feels like an added knowledge layer which will reduce your effort in going through recorded data stats that are difficult to comprehend. 

Features I plan on integrating soon (feel free to contribute if you have anything) : 
- Summary mailed directly to your mail(s).
- LIDA visualisation for direct LLM Graph plots for inferenced data trends.
- Chat using Garmin MCP with Claude.
